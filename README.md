# storybook-nextjs

Fake project to understand how to use Storybook with NextJS and TS stack.

# Steps

Init repo

`yarn init -y`

Install react and next

`yarn add react react-dom next`

Create default nextjs scripts in package.json

- "start": "next start"
- "dev": "next dev"
- "build": "next build"

Run project

`yarn dev`

Obs.: after this, yarn will detect that is necessary to install TS ... follow the instructions and de project will be fine.

Install storybook

`npx storybook init`
